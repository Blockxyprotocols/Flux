# Flux SDK Documentation  

## Introduction  
Flux SDK is a developer-friendly toolkit that enables blockchain transactions without requiring users to pay gas fees. This improves Web3 adoption by simplifying user interactions and improving transaction efficiency.  

## Features  
- âœ… Gasless transactions via meta-transactions  
- âœ… Relayer network support  
- âœ… Secure smart contract interactions  
- âœ… Multi-chain compatibility (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)  
- âœ… JavaScript SDK for easy frontend integration  
- âœ… GraphQL-powered dashboard

## 1. Installation  

### Install the SDK  
```sh
npm install flux-sdk

# Import into Your Project

```sh
import { sendGaslessTransaction } from 'gasless-sdk';

### 2. Getting Started

Initialize SDK
Configure the SDK with your API key and network:

import { GaslessProvider } from 'flux-sdk';
const provider = new GaslessProvider({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  network: "polygon",
});

Sending a Gasless Transaction

const tx = await provider.sendTransaction({
  from: "0xYourWallet",
  to: "0xReceiverAddress",
  data: "0xTransactionData",
});

console.log("Transaction sent:", tx);

3. Smart Contract Integration
Deploying the Gasless Contract

1. Compile & Deploy

npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai

2. Update Frontend Config

const contractAddress = "0xYourDeployedContract";

Interacting with Smart Contracts

const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  abi,
  provider
);
await contract.someFunction();

4. Relayer Setup

Install Dependencies

sh
cd relayer
npm install

Configure Environment (.env)

sh
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com

Start Relayer

sh
node index.js

5. Dashboard Deployment

Install & Start

sh
cd dashboard
npm install
npm start

Access GraphQL API

Open http://localhost:4000/graphql
